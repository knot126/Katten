# Touch pets cats property categories

TPC implements a property system that uses categories (don't know why???) and then actual value index IDs.

## Player

### Category 1

| ID | Purpose |
| -- | ------- |
| 3  | Coins   |

### Category 10

| ID | Purpose |
| -- | ------- |
| 0  | Seems to be 1 if the player is set up, unset if not. |
