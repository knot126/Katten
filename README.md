# Katten Project

Katten is a reverse engineering, documentation and reimplementation of the server software for *Touch Pets Cats* and *Touch Pets Dogs 2*, two games shut down over 10 years ago on 31 March 2013.

## Status

We currently only test on *Touch Pets Cats*, but the two games should be similar enough that they have the same (or very similar) server software.

* Games can boot to the Plus+ account screen
  * Lite accounts work (click "Skip" button); full accounts do not
* **Saving player and pet data does not work** &mdash; you will lose your progress when the game restarts!
* The game is buggy after starting it a second time due to server not loading player and pets properly.
* To conpentsate for this, Katten server gives 100000 coins and 99 of every item for now.
